Windows should now open a new window with the program.

#### <span style="color:red">The hard way</span>

2. Then type "**triplex**" (no caps) in that console. 

The program should now run.

## The technical aspects / the nerdy stuff
### `PrintIntroduction(int Difficulty)`
This function is responsible for printing the unnecessary story at the start of each level. The function takes a `Difficulty` parameter to display the difficulty of the current level you are playing.

### `PlayGame(int Difficulty)`
This function is responsible for a single level. This function also takes a `Difficulty` parameter. This time the parameter is being used to make the level as easy / hard as it should be.
